TAXUS-V was a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of a placlitaxel-eluting stent in a patient population with more complete lesions than previously studied (\cite{Stone2005}) \addmb{*add references*}. 

A total of 2220 patients with unstable angina and myocardial infarction  were enrolled, 
1114 were allocated to the invasive strategy group am 1106 to the conservative strategy group. 
The primary endpoint was the ischemia-driven target vessel revascularization ($\varepsilon_1$) at $9$ months. The secondary endpoints were death ($\varepsilon_2$), myocardial infarction ($\varepsilon_3$), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as death, myocardial infarction or ischemia-driven revascularization ($\varepsilon_1\cup\varepsilon_2\cup\varepsilon_3$).  

%Also, the composite endpoints major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as death from cardiac causes, myocardial infaction or ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization; and target vessel failure defined as death, myocardial infaction or ischemia-driven revascularization.

At the planning stage of the trial, it was estimated that
1172 patients would be needed  to have 85 percent
power to detect a reduction in the primary end
point of ischemia-driven target-vessel revascularization
from an anticipated 15 percent after bare-metal
stenting to 9 percent with the paclitaxel-eluting
stent, a 40 percent relative reduction.
