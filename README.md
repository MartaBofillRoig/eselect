# Adaptive trial designs with selection of composite endpoints and sample size reassessment


This repository contains the R package and main code to reproduce the results of the simulation study in ``Adaptive clinical trial designs with selection of composite endpoints and sample size reassessment’’ by M. Bofill Roig,  G. Gómez, F. Koenig, and M. Posch.

In this work, we consider two-arm randomized controlled trials with a primary composite binary endpoint and an endpoint that consists only of the clinically more important component of the composite endpoint. We propose a trial design that allows an adaptive modification of the primary endpoint based on blinded information obtained at an interim analysis.
